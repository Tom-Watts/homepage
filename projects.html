	<h3>Blocky Net: A new method of NeuroEvoluton</h3>
	<p>
    NeuroEvolution is the process of evolving the weights, parameters and structures of Neural Networks. Currently the most popular method is called NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies).
    As part of a paid summer research scholarship (funded by Victoria University of Wellington) I was tasked with coming up
    with a new algorithm which can work well in high dimensional domains (such as Computer Vision and Genomics). Currently NEAT struggles in high dimensional areas. Initially I experimted using backpropagation with PyTorch as a local seach method for the weights of the networks, however I soon found finding the correct structure (or topology) is as important as learning weights. I then introduced a method which uses mutual information for selecting inputs, and forming new nodes. Despite offering some improvements, these methods were still quite slow, particularly with higher dimensional input spaces. <br> <br>
  Blocky Net: Is a totally new method of NeuroEvolution, where the types of hidden nodes (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh and so on ), weights, and connections between layers are rapidly optimized. This method is designed to overcome typical problems in NEAT such as bloated topologies, and slow learning time. The method generally outperforms NEAT in most high dimensional domains (using MNIST, NLP, Genomics and Mass Spectronomy datasets). It also has embedded feature selection, and since the networks are generally compact, they are relatively easy to intepret compared to standard Neural Networks. <br> <br>

  <h3>Zonko Zonko Game</h3>
  <p>This is an ongoing personal project made in Unity using C# which I have spent at least a few
months on. It is a cute, top down isometric game designed for both Mobile and PC devices. The
main character, Squishy works as a pharmaceutical delivery boy for a manic professor. Note a lot of the code was written when I was starting out, so
is not an indication of the quality of the code I write today ( I have improved a lot! ). </p>
